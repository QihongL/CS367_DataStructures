	Consider the following pseudo-code:

		        println("m caught Ex3");
		    } finally {
		        println("m finally");
		    }
		    println("m end");
		}

		void a( ) {
		    println("a begin");
		    b();
		    try {
		        if (j2) throw new Ex1();
		        c();

		    }
		    println("b end");

		void c( ) {

//		For the each part below determine the complete output that would be 
//		displayed if the pseudo-code above was run with the values of the q 
//		variables as specified below. Assume the exception classes Ex1, Ex2, 
//		and Ex3 each extend RuntimeException. If an exception is passed out 
//		of main, show the output of the runtime environment as "Program "
//				+ "terminated due to Exception ExN", where N is the 
//				particular exception number.
//
//		What would be output if j1 is true and the other variables are false?
//		What would be output if j2 is true and the other variables are false?
//		What would be output if j3 is true and the other variables are false?
//		What would be output if j4 is true and the other variables are false?
//		How would the code need to be modified if exception type Ex1 were 
//		a checked exception? Show only lines of code that with changes.
