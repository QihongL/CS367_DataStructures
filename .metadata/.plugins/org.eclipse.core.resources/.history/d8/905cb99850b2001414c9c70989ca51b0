//
//1. What would be output if j1 is true and the other variables are false?
//2. What would be output if j2 is true and the other variables are false?
//3. What would be output if j3 is true and the other variables are false?
//4. What would be output if j4 is true and the other variables are false?
//5. How would the code need to be modified if exception type Ex1 were 
//a checked exception? Show only lines of code that with changes.
